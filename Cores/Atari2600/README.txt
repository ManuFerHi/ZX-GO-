Port of the A2601 FPGA implementation for the ZXUNO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations:
- Needs a PS/2 keyboard to access the menu (Esc key) and load roms
- supports only player one controller

All zxuno related files including the Quartus project files are in the 'zxuno' subdirectory.

Port of the A2601 FPGA implementation for the MiST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buttons:
- right MiST button -> Start
- Keyboard 1        -> Select
- Keyboard 2        -> BW/Color (yellow led on = Color)
- Keyboard F12      -> OSD to select roms from the sd card (needs extension .a26)

Current limitations:
- supports only the common Atari bank switching schemes
- no illegal opcodes

All MiST related files including the Quartus project files are in the 'mist' subdirectory.

A2601: An FPGA-based clone of the Atari 2600 video game console (Release 0.1.0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This archive contains source code for VHDL implementation and Python script 
utilities for the A2601 video game console project.

VHDL source code provided includes implementation of the 6502(7) CPU, the TIA, 
the 6532 RIOT, additional audio/video/joypad circuitry and bankswitching schemes 
plus additional RAM used by some game cartridges. Test benches are supplied for 
all main components (although they may be slightly out of date).

The 6502 CPU core has been developed from scratch for this project. It contains 
hand-crafted finite state machine and controls that implement all documented 
6502 opcodes. It synthesizes quickly and has good performance in the simulator. 

The TIA implementation digitally synthesizes NTSC composite video signal via a 
lookup table that contains a sequence of values that signifies a sine wave at 
correct phase for each one of the 16 chrominance values selectable in the TIA. 

You should be able to synthesize the A2601 in Xilinx ISE without any major 
problems. No project files are included, but it is best to create these 
yourself, anyway. Two top level entities are provided: One reads cartridge ROM 
data from on-board flash memory, the other stores the ROM data in the FPGA 
built-in SRAM. It is also possible to run A2601 sources in a VHDL simulator. 
Some helper utilities and a test bench are provided for this purpose in the 
A2601/util directory.
