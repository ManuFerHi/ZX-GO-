fpganes port for ZXUNO
2016 DistWave

Original readme:

fpganes
=======

This is the source code for my FPGA NES.

It's designed to run on the Nexys4 board and built with
Xilinx ISE.

Use "loader" to download ROMS to it over the built-in UART.

"loader" also transmits joypad commands from my USB joypad
to the FPGA across UART.
