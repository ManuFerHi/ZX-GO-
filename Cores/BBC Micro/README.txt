To use Disk drive emulation in SD card: 

- Format SD card to FAT/FAT32.
 Do NOT do a fast format. Let it format the slow way.

- Put a disk collection image named "BEEB.MMB" in the SD card.
 Be sure that the file is the FIRST file you put in the SD after formatting.
 (IMPORTANT).
(You can make your own MMB file with MMBImager.exe, or download prepared MMB files over the net (p.e.:  http://fileshack.net/v4hcbpffhwnl)

 Run core and press Shift+F12 to boot from the prepared image.
