ZX GO + is a FPGA board with the form factor adapted to fit into an original Spectrum 48k or Spectrum + case (for Spectrum + case it is necessary to adapt the reset button, make a hole or remove the button and use the original Spectrum + reset, it is also convenient to pass a drill through the holes because the PCB is forced).

Connections.
